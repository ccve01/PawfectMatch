A Tinder-style adoption app for pets that lets you talk to them before you adopt using AI

## üêæ FAQ 

#### How does it work?

Using the **Petfinder API** and the unofficial **Characterai API**, ***Pawfect Match*** shows local adoptable animals in your area based on the preferences that you give it, and lets you save them in a database

#### How do you talk to them?

In your matches, you can go through and talk to each animal that you have chosen, and the AI will pick the corresponding animal to talk to. While this is happening, the contact information for this animal will be shown if you wanted to go through and adopt.

#### Can I upload my own animal?

Yes! If you click the **Profile** button, you can input the information and upload a photo of your own pet.
